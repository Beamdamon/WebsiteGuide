                A web application is a software application that runs on web servers and is accessed through a web browser. Web applications can be accessed by many users simultaneously across the internet, or by a limited number of users on an intranet. Web applicaitions can have a massive variety of purposes, such as gaming, media services, banking, learning, and thousands of others depending on the intent of their creators.

            <p> 
                As web applications often store user's data, they typically use a database in order to do so. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most popular language used to handle web application data. Databases use SQL to store and retrieve user data on the back-end, hidden from the users of the application. SQL contains a variety of commands to interact with the database in many different ways, delivering a seamless experience for the user.
